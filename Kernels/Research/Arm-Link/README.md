- This library is a research project focused on the software developer's business
- This is a software interface for a stream-based computing, made for RTOS or bare metal
- This framework integrates a scheduler and manages the data moves and format changes

The purpose is to :
- avoid the system integrator to worry with software components implementation and interface details
- avoid the software component developer to bother about integration, memory map and peripherals
- let more software developers join our ecosystem, and prepare a path for monetization
- create a graphical environment to enable fast DSP/ML prototyping
- create a safe and secure environement
- solve the limitations of memory-bounded algorithms and get performance scalability with multiprocessing
