## PRELIMINARY DATA -- IN DEVELOPMENT 

***WHAT***

**Graph-Interpreter** is a scheduler of **DSP/ML nanoApps** designed with three objectives: 

1. **Accelerate time to market**

Graph-Interpreter helps system integrators and OEM who develop complex DSP/ML stream processing. It allows going fast from prototypes validated on a computer to the final tuning steps on production boards, by updating a graph of computing nodes and their coefficients without device recompilation.  

2. **NanoApps repositories**

It provides an opaque interface of the platform memory hierarchy to the computing nodes. It arranges the data flow is translated to the desired formats of each node. It prepares the conditions where nodes will be delivered from a Store. 

3. **Portability, scalability**

Use the same stream-based processing methodology from devices using 1 Kbytes of internal RAM to multiprocessor heterogeneous architectures. Nodes can be produced in any programming languages. The Graph are portable when interpreted on another platform.
