# Prestudies and Calibration

The python files in this directory are meant to be run on a desktop using opencv.
They do on a desktop what is done inside the firmware.
They are useful to understand, debug or develop what is inside the firmware without all the problems like
 memory issues, flashing or not being able to know why it crashed.


# Calibration

calibration_and_stereo.py is needed to create the big remap arrays that are inside the firmware and used to
fix the stereo images problems (lens correction, rotation or translation between the 2 images)

This Step is done offline, on the desktop and not in the camera but still using pictures generated by the 2 cameras.
